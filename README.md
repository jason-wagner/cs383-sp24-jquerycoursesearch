# cs383-sp24-jquerycoursesearch

This is an example from CS 383 from the Spring 2022 semester to select courses for registration using jQuery/AJAX.

Please note that for the sake of getting through the example during the scheduled class time, some "shortcuts" are taken that should be completed when building an app intended for production, as described in the lecture.
